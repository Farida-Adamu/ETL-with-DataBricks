# ETL-with-DataBricks

Summary
The aim of this project is to enrich an existing client portfolio (csv data)with data from the finnhub APi using data bricks and python.
In this project we are extracting financial inforamtion from a particular profile of companiess on finnhub.Finnhub is a realtime API for stocks, forex and cryptocurrency.
To achieve the needed output, you need to install the libraries for requests and json, Also go to finnhub api documentation and sign up to get an API token. You will also be needing a Databricks account.
NOTE; If you are using a community version of databricks, which is what i use, you may not be able to do a github integration. For this reason i uploaded the py and html versions of the notebook from my Databricks workspace.
